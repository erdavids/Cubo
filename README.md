# Cubo

An implementation / homage of this old paper: http://www.edwardzajec.com/tvc4/pil1/index.html. These images are created with a type of [Truchet Tile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truchet_tiles) structure. 

If you want to run this project yourself, make sure to download [Processing](https://www.processing.org) and use the Python module. Reach out to thebuffed@gmail.com if you have any questions.
